    header: 'What I\'ve done!',
    paragraphOne: `During my formal education and training, I embarked on software development using programming languages like C/C++. This experience instilled in me the necessary confidence to recognize that Computer Engineering was my true calling. In the initial phases of my programming journey, I immersed myself in languages such as C, C++, C#, Python, and JavaScript. These languages became pivotal in my academic projects, where I delved into various topics, including object-oriented programming, memory management, resource allocation, and multithreading.
    
        Nonetheless, among this array of languages, two particular ones ignited my intellectual curiosity as an engineer: Python and C#. I harnessed the power of these programming languages for the development of neural networks, employing them in tasks related to function approximation and input categorization. This was accomplished through the utilization of activation functions and algorithms such as gradient descent and Levenberg-Marquardt.`,
    paragraphTwo: `As I transitioned into my professional career as a Computer Engineer at OpenMarket, the wealth of knowledge I had acquired became instrumental. It allowed me to comprehend the intricate algorithmic nature of instant messaging software (MMS). This understanding enabled me to effectively mitigate bottlenecks within the information processing pipeline and execute meticulous monitoring through the integration of tools like Prometheus, Graylog, OpsGenie, and more.

        In the present day, having accumulated significant experience in the industry, I have expanded my technical expertise to include a broader spectrum of technologies. These encompass Java, Spring Boot, JUnit, TypeScript, ReactJs, CSS, Jest, Cypress, WebDriverIO, Azure Static Web Apps, Jenkins, Webpack, Prometheus Metrics, and Bash scripting.`,
